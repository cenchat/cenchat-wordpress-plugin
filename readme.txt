Civilized commenting service.

== Description ==

Cenchat is a commenting service with a unique way to prevent trolls, harassment, negativity, and spam to happen around your work.

= Built to prevent online harassment =

**Playful conversations**

Continuously provide a positive environment around your work. Your audiences can add texts to their comments when replying to their followers. To anyone else, only GIFs and stickers are available.

**Controlled feedback**

Your stories are great and we'd like to talk more about it with you. As a site admin, your audiences can reply with text comments only to you.

= Designed to make the important comments discoverable =

**Personalization**

Comments we like from people we care about. In Cenchat, when you follow someone, you see their comments first.

**No deep threading**

Discussions are flat but we also allow 1 level deep of replies. Now you don't have to worry about missing responses buried underneath the reply chain.

= Brings you more audience =

**Share the best comments**

Anyone can be famous. It just takes one comment. You'll also get more traffic when they do.

**Tag the awesome people**

Sharing your work is great but we can do more. In Cenchat, your audiences can tag other people giving you the opportunity for more engagement.
