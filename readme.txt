Messaging for websites and blogs

== Description ==

Cenchat is a plugin for websites where it reinvents how your audiences can have a conversation with youâ€”the author.

People are only allowed to send private messages to you so the public (and mostly toxic) conversations can happen elsewhere. As an author, you can then publicize those conversations as read-only so the insightful ones can stand out.

== Installation ==

1. In your WordPress Dashboard, go to **Plugins > Add New**
2. Search for **Cenchat**
3. Click **Install**
4. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** screen in your WordPress Dashboard
5. Go to **Cenchat** in your Wordpress Dashboard to configure the plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Sign up then register your website at [web.cenchat.com](https://web.cenchat.com).

= Is Cenchat free to use on my site? =

Yes it's completely free, without limits, and it doesn't have any ads.

Note that there will also be paid plans in the future. Once we introduce it, free tier limits will be adjusted.

= What browsers are supported? =

We support all modern browsers. Internet Explorer isn't one of them.

= How can I manage the chats on my blog? =

= Do you sync the comments back to WordPress? =

No we don't. Cenchat's form of discussion is different from traditional commenting. We're still studying on how we can best implement this feature.

= Can I import my existing WordPress comments into Cenchat? =

No you can't. Cenchat's form of discussion is different from traditional commenting. This prevents us from allowing comments import.
